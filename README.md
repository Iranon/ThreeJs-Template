# ThreeJs-Template

It implements *three.module.js* inside the main script file (*threeScript.js*) and it imports Loaders (glTF and OBJ), Controls and custom GLSL shaders (as *.js* file inside the shaders folder).

You can look at the folders structure inside the *Directory_Structure.txt* file. Missing folders (and files) belong to the [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/).

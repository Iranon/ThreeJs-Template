# ThreeJs-Template

It implements *three.module.js* inside the main script file (*threeScript.js*) and it imports Loaders (glTF and OBJ), Controls and custom GLSL shaders (as *.js* file inside the shaders folder).

You can look at the folders structure inside the [*Directory_Structure.txt*](https://github.com/Iranon/ThreeJs-Template/blob/main/Directory_Structure.txt) file. Missing folders (and files) belong to the [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/).

Textures are missing too: they are only for example purpose.

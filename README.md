# ThreeJs-Template

It implements *three.module.js* inside the main script file (*threeScript.js*) and it imports Loaders (glTF and OBJ), Controls and custom GLSL shaders (as *.js* file inside the shaders folder).

Missing imports belong to the [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/). Three.js npm package available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three).

Textures are missing too: they are only for example purpose.
